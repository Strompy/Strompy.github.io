Hi! I'm, Phillip

![Me](/assets/Photo.jpg)


I'm a software engineer and classical musician. Currently working in Ruby on Rails.

Formerly, I planned and produced concerts with the Colorado Symphony, bringing a wide range of guest musicians to perform with the orchestra from Yo-Yo Ma to The Flaming Lips.

In my spare time you'll find me hiking, skiing, making music, and supporting Arsenal 🔴⚪️
