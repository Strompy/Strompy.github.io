# Career Day

## Overview

Career Day is a progressive web app built to help middle school aged kids explore possible career options that they may not have known were open to them. Users can explore a wide range of careers, search for specific careers or salaries, and then take a dive into the details.

This app was built in two weeks with a group of five developers for our final project at Turing. We were encouraged to explore new technologies and implement them in the app, so we built a Python/Flask backend and utilized React Hooks for the frontend. We presented at the Turing Code Fair.

## My Areas of Focus

This project allowed me to explore a whole new tech stack, learning new technologies in a short time including:

- Building an API with Flask to serve up data for a front-end team
- Utilizing the SQLAlchemy ORM to interact with a postgreSQL database
- Learning basics of Python
- Automated testing with Pytest and Postman
- Implementing TravisCI and Heroku continuous deployment

# ShelfShare

## Overview

[ShelfShare](https://shelf-share.herokuapp.com/) is a peer-to-peer platform for sharing physical books. We simplify the loan-and-return process for books by keeping track of who is borrowing what, so you'll never forget!

Search for your friends and their books on ShelfShare. Ask to borrow their books and loan your books out too!

This app was built in nine days with a group of three developers. The idea was fully created by the team. We implemented a microservice ([BookBuddy](https://github.com/Shelf-Share-BEE-Mod3/book_buddy)) to support the main application. We followed an agile workflow utilizing GitHub project boards and presented at the Turing Code Fair.

## My Areas of Focus

This is the first student pitched project I worked on. It allowed me to work on taking an idea from the drawing board to production in an agile team environment. I learned how to prioritize development of key features to allow us to reach our minimum viable product. An additional challenge was a key technology pivot, once I learned that the API we were initially utilizing to gather book data was not viable, I had to quickly research and implement an alternative.

Technologies:

* Ruby on Rails for the main app
* Sinatra for the microservice
* RSpec for testing
* PostgreSQL for the database
* HTML / CSS for accessible UX/UI
* Google Books API for book data
* Google OAuth for user authentication
* Heroku for deployment
* TravisCI for continuous integration
